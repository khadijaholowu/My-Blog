<p>HI I'm Khadijah! I am a junior at Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School and I enjoy math and science. My first day at Girls Who Code, I had no idea of what computer science was. Thanks to all of my wonderful teachers and fellow classmates, I have learned so much and am able to share my experiences with others. </p> 
<h2> Girls Who Code </h2>
<p2>At Girls Who Code, I got to meet amazing people and learn cool things. Some of which include processing JavaScript using Khan Academy. Here is one of my projects that I worked on with Katia :) </p2>
